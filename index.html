                Haha!. It's finally the day. I waited for so long. Girl is finally 20. Happy birthday faii!. You are the more than just a friend. I consider you as my cousin sister, a close family member and a best friend. You probably know me better than i know myself. You know what i like, what i love, what i hate. You applaud my passions and tolerate my faults. You're there for me, always. And it's not always what we say, or what we do because you, by yourself, is enough. You, with your smile, your laugh, your friendship. It's more than i deserve. We've had our days of blue. and we're stronger
                than ever. Because all i know is if you aren't here I wouldn't be complete. My circle wouldn't be as amazing without the presence of your amazing soul! Love you sis! Vaane kaan dhaan. Mi dhiya faharu dhiaee muchas akannu. Dhen faharakun adhi othee ingey. Once again, Happy birthday. Hope to see you soon!

                Happy birthday faii. I'm so grateful to have met you. Pretty, and sweet, were the first things I noticed about you. You treated me like I was a hama good friend even on the day we met, and that honestly made me feel happy. 
                (I'm a pretty awkward person but I didn't feel awkward around you) We may not have many memories together but I'm hoping time will change that. Keep being the amazing person you are. Lot's of love.

                Happy birthday faii, thank you for all the help and the advice you've given over the years. You are a great friend and someone who can change someone's opinion just by talking.
                Well, you are getting old now. I guess that means more knowledge and better advice for all of us. Happy 20th birthday. Enjoy!
